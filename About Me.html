            <h1>How I Got My Passion for Electrical Engineering</h1>
            <p class = "passion">   Growing up I always wondered what I was going to do in life. 
                I always was attracted to creativity and the different
                designs of all kinds of things like origami, paper airplanes, super heroes
                and more, but as I grew up, I didn't know what career I wanted
                in the future. This changed when I was in 7th grade. During this time
                 I was taught HTML and CSS. At first, the class was very difficult, and I thought
                 that coding wasn't something I wanted to get involved in, but as time went on
                 and as I successfully completed more tasks with html and css, I started to enjoy 
                 coding, and I decided that I wanted coding to be part of my future job.<br><br>
                    When I reached high school, I started to grow a new interest in the other 
                 applications of electrical engineering. The truth is that
                  I was just excited and just drawn into it. First it started out as something small like
                 admiring cool inventions or watching people code on tiktok or youtube but soon 
                 it grew into something bigger. It grew into the desire to take action and
                  to practice electrical engineering. <br><br>
                  After this, I joined my school's Biomedical Engineering Club and later, Team Illusion
                  Robotics. Due to these clubs, I got to work on different projects and learned numerous
                  concepts, principles, and hardware. While robotics and engineering is a part of my
                   life, there are still other parts of my life that I would like to show you.
