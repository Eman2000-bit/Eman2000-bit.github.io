                1. AP Award With Distinction<br>
                I  received the 2025 AP Scholar Distinction Award for College Board due to my performance on the 2025 AP Exam. To get 
                this award, I needed an average score of at least 3.5 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on 5+ AP exams. 
                <br><br>
                2. Principals Honor Roll<br>
                To get the principal honor roll award per quarter, I needed a 4.0 GPA each quarter. I am glad to announce that 
                I have a consistant record of principal honor roll awards from my freshmen year to my senior year.

                    Through my dedication and hardwork in STEM, I have proudly given numerous STEM Awards by my 
                    school. One of those awards given to me is the STEM Star Award, which was given to me due to my 
                    outstanding performance as a STEM leader in the 2024 CMIT NORTH STEM Institute, in which I mentored 
                    the rising 9th graders and encouraged participation in STEM Clubs.

                     for my peers, demonstrate my commitment to growth, innovation, and service, have a good record of conduct with
